const ABOUT_ME = `
I am a highly skilled and innovative Full Stack Developer
with over 4 years of hands-on experience designing, developing
and optimizing interactive, user-friendly and feature-rich
web applications. I am a focused and efficient learner
with not only experience on the backend and frontend but also
practical expertise across the entire development stack including
testing, analytics, architecture and cybersecurity.
I am able to effectively self-manage during independent projects,
as well as collaborate appropriately in a team setting in order
to efficiently implement new features for an existing product based
on user feedback or build new innovative projects from start to finish.
When I'm not coding, I'm either watching series,
playing video games or working out.
Other times I am reading or learning a new language or framework.
