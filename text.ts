const ABOUT_ME = `
I am a Full Stack Developer with over 3 years of experience
designing, developing and optimizing interactive, user-friendly
and feature-rich  web applications.
I started my career as a Cybersecurity Analyst,
performing penetration tests and code audits
on a wide variety of web applications.
After a short while, I decided to take the leap to pursue a career
as a Full Stack Developer and started participating in projects
where I have been trained to have both technical and soft skills,
focusing specially on Python and Typescript
but always keeping in mind that one must be ready
to learn any language or framework,
making use of innovation, ingenuity and creativity
to create the best applications with the resources available.
When I'm not coding, I'm either watching series,
playing video games or working out.
Other times I am reading or learning a new language or framework.
